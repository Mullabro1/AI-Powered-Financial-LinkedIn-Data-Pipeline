    "about": "My years at Erdem, I felt like the magician of every woman's dream wardrobe. Each piece blended traditional elegance with modern innovation, like classic and avant-garde in one. If I could make you feel like a superstar when you wore them, then I'd achieved my goal. The details? Of course, I was obsessed with every detail, because true beauty lies in making every woman feel her own unique brilliance.<br><br>During my time at DVF, I was completely enchanted by the world of design. Diane von Furstenberg is known for her bold colors and sexy style, and I was excited to bring fresh blood to this legendary brand. From the iconic wrap dress to those instantly charming prints, each design is infused with a deep understanding of femininity. After the relaunch of DVF, our goal is to make every wearer feel confident and elegant. This experience has not only made me a more mature designer, but also given me a deeper understanding of fashion - and this is how I like to live a stylish and humorous life.",

        "description": "For my Master's thesis, I designed and brought to succession an ambitious project that not only explored a largely untouched area in neuroscience research but also sought to combine knowledge from the contrasting fields of fine arts and neurosciences to address the research question. This project pushed me to conduct extensive research in both fields and gave me the opportunity to understand the topic holistically. I scheduled the timeline of the project independently and thus, learnt to manage my time and schedule while working at a very fast pace. I also creatively collaborated with my research group through weekly meetings, which helped sharpen ideas and improve the output.Halfway through the project, I found that a large portion of my data would be unusable due to a coding error in the program we were using. I decided to use this as an opportunity to be creative - I looked into the research question to identify exactly what we were measuring and made alterations to fit the new model, and after conducting some statistical sanity checks, adjusted the project to the existing data without losing sight of the research question. This turned out to be a good idea and the project was a success. It is now being evaluated for inspiring further research at King's College London."

Hence I chose to be in a business that allows me to simulate human behaviour â Brand and Marketing Management.<br><br>This profession also comes from my view of the world, where I feel that in the coming years, the professional pursuits are drastically going to change. When today it is categorized as STEM and non-STEM majors, sooner we might see human experiences, behaviour analysis, and counselling, etc. becoming one of the largest professional majors in India as well.<br><br>Over the last 6 years, I have successfully managed design and delivery of brand communication across various marketing functions like Advertising, Digital & Social Marketing, Design Development, Brand Image Development, Market Research and Strategic Brand Management functions. <br><br>I enjoy working on finding, analysing, unearthing insights from seemingly irrational consumer behaviour, helping companies in conceptualizing and delivering marketing and branding strategies that drive loyalty, customer engagement, and brand awareness. <br><br>I also particularly enjoy working on extension of brand concepts across different cultures and geographies. The exposure to all types of management viz MNC, Family businesses, Start-ups, semi corporate with an understanding of different consumer buying behaviour like impulse, high involvement, premium & functional have been a highlight of my evolution in this brand management world.<br><br>In this journey, I have been proudly engaged with various industries like FMCG, Healthcare, Media & Entertainment, Manufacturing, Retail, etc., and exciting brands like Wagh Bakri, Lactalis India (Anik & Prabhat), HiCare, Mid-Day, IIM-U, Haldirams, Shott, LP Industries to name the big ones.<br><br>My motivation comes from learning and doing new things, like taking a course on Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to understand the roots of thinking behaviour, or following my school time passion for classical music, or a desire to start something, like I did start an advertising knowledge sharing page on Instagram by the name âAds â Made in Indiaâ which needs to swing in action again. <br><br>I believe that my passion, motivation, learning attitude, flexible mindset, ability to un-learn, re-learn and thrive in a fast-moving environment, and most importantly experimenting attitude is something that allows me to fit into your work environment as this sets me apart.",

    "about": "I embarked on a journey into training and education since 1999. As an educationist, I have a strong will to change the system, give room to new thoughts and make the substantial contribution towards the society by creating qualified professionals. <br><br>A Computer Engineer by qualification and hailing from a humble background, the path as an entrepreneur wasnât easy. I believe that an achiever in the World is the product of motivation, which is born out of the struggle to fulfill any desire. The zeal and undying passion gave that birth to this unique initiative in the nation by the name \"Virtual Voyage\" College of Media,Design & Management.<br><br> I give the credit to my students of initial years for developing me to this stature. The strong connect with the students, ability to understand their apprehension and the vision to generate bright employment opportunities gave me courage & allowed  to expand self-horizon and create opportunities for many.<br><br> With a Hindi medium schooling background, I faced a tough time dealing with Engineering and Computer books. I had spent a valuable time in learning English. The thought was to overcome the language barrier and complete the degree successfully. That was the phase when the seeds of entrepreneurship were sown. I started with my first English-speaking classes âAmbienceâ with an aim to help students to overcome with their fear of speaking English. <br> <br>Virtual Voyage is an institution that serves as a platform for students to enhance the overall educational experience of young minds through a range of extracurricular programs, facilities, services and activities. It has emerged as countryâs most unique and biggest training academy. The campus offers 30 handpicked courses and it not only breaks the conventional opinions of parents, peer and educational counsellors, but has also excelled well in positioning the so-called secondary career courses as mainstream options.<br><br>",

Following my graduation, my first job was as a Transportation Engineer for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority where I was able to pursue my passion for trains by working on the Mumbai Metro and especially the planning of the fully underground 33km Metro Line 3.  <br><br>At StudioPOD, I have been able to continue working on metro rail projects in Mumbai, Bangalore, and Delhi as well as other transportation projects including street designs and multi-modal integration plans. Recently I have also started studying and developing innovative and sustainable financing strategies for the various transportation, and master planning projects the office is working on.   <br><br>An unfortunate lack of sporting talent has resulted in me not being successful in following my sporting passions. As an amateur sportsman, on weekends you will find me either on the football pitch or maidans clumsily trying to emulate the exploits of his sporting heroes.",
