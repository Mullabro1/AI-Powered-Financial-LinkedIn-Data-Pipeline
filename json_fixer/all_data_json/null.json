    "About Text": "As the co-founder of Sternum, I’ve been fortunate to lead a groundbreaking journey in IoT and device security. Together with an exceptional team, we built patented technology from the ground up to tackle some of the toughest challenges in this space, including runtime memory protection, control flow integrity, and anomaly detection. Before founding Sternum, I served in Israel's elite Unit 8200 and gained extensive experience as a vulnerability researcher and team leader across multiple companies. During this time, I developed a deep technical foundation in cybersecurity, specializing in zero-day vulnerability discovery and exploitation of complex systems. This expertise shaped Sternum’s approach to securing IoT devices at scale. Our work has enabled us to partner with industry leaders in the medical and defense sectors, working alongside innovators in various industries to transform medical device security and safeguard critical military assets. Raising over $35M in funding and reaching multi-million-dollar ARR were milestones, but what I value most are the relationships we built with our team and customers along the way.",
